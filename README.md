# GeoFS Addons

An all-in-one repository for the GeoFS addon menu, GeoFS addon manager and related scripts.

Curently, the addon manager is in development and is not yet available for public use. The addons that come with the repository dont yet have a usable menu, but can be individually enabled/disabled via the browser extension.

### `addons.json` example:

```json
	{
		"name": "Slew Mode",
		"description": "Slew mode from FSX",
		"version": "1.0",
		"script": "slewmode.js",
		"author": "tylerbmusic",
		"repository": "https://github.com/tylerbmusic/GeoFS-Slew-Mode"

	},
```

### `addons.json` schema:

```json
	{
		"name": "name of the addon (MUST BE UNIQUE)",
		"description": "basic description of the addon",
		"version": "version number for debugging",
		"script": "slewmode.js // the *.js script that will be loaded into the page",
		"author": "creator of the addon (github username)",
		"repository": "link to GitHub repository"
	},
```

# Addon Menu Docs

> The `addonMenu.js` script is injected into the page and provides an API for creating a settings menu for addons.

## Initial Setup

Paste the code below into your script(s) or use the entire extension

(see: [loading an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked))

```javascript
if (!window.gmenu || !window.GMenu) {
	fetch(
		"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylerbmusic/GeoFS-Addon-Menu/refs/heads/main/addonMenu.js"
	)
		.then((response) => response.text())
		.then((script) => {
			eval(script);
		})
		.then(() => {
			setTimeout(afterGMenu, 100);
		});
}

function afterGMenu() {
	// Setup goes here
}
```

Remove `// Setup goes here`, and in that line, create a variable and initialize it to a `new GMenu("Your addon name", "Short identifier for your addon")`. A good short identifier does not have any spaces, and is ideally less than 5 letters long.  
For example, `const twLM = new window.GMenu("Taxiway Lights", "twL");` is what I used for my Taxiway Lights addon.

## Functions/Methods

To add settings, you can call a few methods.  
_Note: The defaultValue should always be a string, and ALL LOCALSTORAGE VALUES ARE STRINGS. This means that checkbox values, for instance, will be either "true" or "false"._  
_Also Note: A title header, an Enabled checkbox, and a reset button are automatically created, so it is not necessary to create them manually._

- `addItem(description, lsName, type, level, defaultValue)`: Adds an item to the menu. Options:
  - description: String, a very short description;
  - lsName: String, the name used for localStorage retrieval/storage (also the id name), will be automatically prefixed by the prefix, the first letter should be capitalized;
  - type: any of the standard HTML input types;
  - level: Integer, the indentation of the item, where 0 is no indentation;
  - defaultValue: Self explanatory, the value if the item was not set or was reset.
  - options: Optional String, additional HTML attributes to add to the element.
- `addKBShortcut(description, lsName, level, defaultValue, fn)`: Adds a keyboard shortcut to the menu (this method is similar to the addItem method, but adds a keydown listener and function). Shortcut values can either be keys (like 'a', '-', or '$') or codes (like keyA or Minus), but multiple-key shortcuts are not supported. Options:
  - description: Same as `addItem`
  - lsName: Same as `addItem`
  - level: Same as `addItem`
  - defaultValue: Same as `addItem`
  - fn: A function to be run when the key is pressed down
- `addButton(title, fn)`: Adds a button to the menu. Options:
  - title: String, the button's title;
  - fn: A function to be run when the button is clicked.
- `addHeader(level, text)`: Adds a header of the specified level (from 1 to 6, but it is recommended to start at 2 as h1 is used for the addon titles)

## Getting values

To get non-checkbox values, use `localStorage.getItem('prefixlsName')` (for example, if I had created a text input with the lsName `Test` and I had constructed the menu with the prefix `ex`, I could get its value by calling `localStorage.getItem('exTest')`.)  
Since all localStorage values are strings, checkbox items' localStorage values will either be "true" or "false", so to get them, use `(localStorage.getItem('prefixlsName') == 'true')`
